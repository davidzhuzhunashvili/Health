<!-- Order of events:
  -Webpack runs
  #Meanwhile on request index.html is served because of app.use(express.static)
  #Initally index.html has nothing inside of it and returns an empty html page
  -Starts looking from main.js and looks at all dependancies
  -Bundles everything together and also uses babel to produce ES5 code
  -Loads the full js file into the script
  -Runs the script (first thing to run is the render of app.js in main.js)
  -Components start to appear on the empty index.html (/) page
